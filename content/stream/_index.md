# Cloudflare Stream

Cloudflare Stream provides end-to-end video infrastructure at scale. Stream handles storage, encoding and adaptive bitrate playback for you so you can focus your core idea.

Stream decides which bitrate, resolution, and codec is best for you and delivers all videos to industry standard H264 codec. Stream uses different adaptive streaming levels from 360p to 1080p to ensure smooth streaming for audiences watching on different devices and bandwidth constraints.

Additionally, you can use all of the Stream Live features as long as you have a Cloudflare subscription. If you cancel your Stream subscription, videos are removed within 30 days.

Refer to the [Reference](/stream/reference) for more information on supported browsers and mobile platforms.

For information about pricing, refer to [Simplified pricing of Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) at the bottom of the Stream page.
